    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

    <p>
      The name is Fredrick Ondara Onenga once known as Alex Ondara. This illustrious baby boss Guru is a half-cast and got lucky enough to learn and speak two local languages at a very young age. He has shifted schools a couple of times, meaning he has met many people in life — some positive, some just... others. He lives by quotes, like a verse from Justin Bieber's song *A Lifetime*: “Some people come into your life for a reason, others for a season.”

      Raised under tough conditions, the boy always felt the need to improve and become a better version of himself. By God's grace, he dreams of becoming a respected, wealthy individual. His greatest achievement? In high school, he invented a new math formula for solving quadratics, earning recognition up to the regional level.

      After high school, he passed well and became a high school teacher. During that time, he learned great communication skills and gained deep knowledge of forex, the financial market, and stocks. He earned personal achievements through his drive and curiosity.

      From a young age, he loved sports and chess. Football took him places — from school captain to local league leader nicknamed "Masta." Sadly, university life shifted priorities, but the passion lives on.

      His skills include: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and low-level languages like LUA, Arduino, C, and C++. He's experienced in robotics, embedded systems, and IoT with Raspberry Pi. He’s also skilled in 3D simulation using CoppeliaSim (V-REP) and has integrated Matlab with the Pioneer P3DX robot.
